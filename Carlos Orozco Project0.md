# Carlos Orozco Project0
Hello! This is my ReadMe.md for Project0.

I decided the theme of the webpages should include three of my personal interests and hobbies being Computer Science, Fitness and Entrepreneurship.

I have met all project requirements and this ReadMe.md will walk through my webpages and completed objectives.


# Files Included
The files included in my folder are as follows:
- Index.html (This is my main webpage)
- CS.html (One of three webpages that are linked in Inex.html)
- FE.html (One of three webpages that are linked in Inex.html)
- E.html (One of three webpages that are linked in Inex.html)
- style.css (CSS file that contains CSS and SCSS code)
- Various image files used to display onto the webpages


## Having four different .html pages that link to eachother via hyperlink
- Any of the webpages can be accessed from any webpage.
- This was achieved in all my webpages via the Navigation bar.
- The Navigation bar includes four links, that if clicked on, will take you to one of the four following html files; Index.html, CS.html, FE.html and E.html. 

## Have at least one list, one table and one image

- I created an unordered list in my main webpage containing three of my hobbies 
- A table was also included each row containing a popular lift and my personal record
- An image was added to the webpage right besides my name

## Include at least one CSS file
- I included one .CSS file to my folder by the name of style.css which influences the look and feel of the index.html webpage


## Stylesheet must use at least 5 CSS properties & Selectors included #id and .class

- I make use of the #id function to change the background color of where "moretext" is located to yellow
- I use the .class function to assign traits to a couple of buttons instead of having to retype everything individually
- I change the style of the list by setting the style of the unordered list to have circles instead of bullet points by implementing this line "list-style-type: circle;"
- I change the thickness of the border for the table to 2 pixels by inmplementing this line of code, "border: 2px solid black;"
- I change the padding of the table to 5 pixels by implementing the line, "padding: 5px;"

## Stylesheet must include a mobile responsive @media query

I accomplished this task by telling the web browser to change the background color of the webpage when the webpage is displayed on a smaller device. In this case when the screen length goes below 800 pixels the background will turn light blue.


## Using Bootstrap 4 on my webpage
I used Bootstrap 4 on my webpage by incorporating it's navigation bar and various other formatting features exclusive to Bootstrap 4

## Implementing SCSS
- I initially implemented SCSS by creating a variable named "button" that is to be used to store dimensions for other buttons.
- This comes in handy because we are nesting the values that other buttons can inherit 
- SCSS Inhereting happens when we use the @extend function to grab values from the original button variable instead of having to write them all over again.
